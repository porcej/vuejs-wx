## Notes
- Based on Smashing Magazine's Article [Using Vue.js To Create an Interactive Weather Dashboard With APIs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/interactive-weather-dashboard-api-vue-js/).
- Google API now charges so this will be refractored to use another Geo Location Service
- *wxUtils.js* was created to pull the utility functions out of *App.vue*
